Note: to run the backend server with python, go to where app.py is located and run '$ python app.py'

This is my first project after a while without coding for myself. This is also my first project using a third-party LLM (large language model).

The aims of this website is to be a 'Robo ED' copy with my personal tweaks to make it more modern and create a new robot personality.

I started using the deepseek open source LLM through the OpenRouter API.

I am also trying to implement a decision tree that will work as a non-generative AI to give the user already thougth out replies.
